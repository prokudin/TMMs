"Transverse Momentum Moments"
By Oscar del Rio, Alexei Prokudin, Ignazio Scimemi and Alexey Vladimirov

----Variables and constants defined in the Mathematica-format file

x: Parton momentum fraction
as: QCD coupling constant
nc: Numbers of colours (nc=3 for QCD)
nf: Number of light quark flavours
CF: Casimir operators of the fundamental representation of the SU(nc) group, CF = (nc^2-1)/(2nc)
CA: Casimir operators of then adjoint representation of the SU(nc) group, CA = nc
TR: Dynkin index, or trace normalization factor, associated with the representation R of the SU(nc). For the fundamental representation of SU(Nc), TF=1/2.
PolyLog[a,z]: Poly logarithms (PLs) where a is the index of the PL and z is the argument.
DELTA[1-z]: Delta function with argument 1-z
PlusD[1-z,a]: Plus distribution [log(1-z)^a/(1-z)]_+.
